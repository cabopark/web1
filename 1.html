  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" target="_blank" title="test">Trump was born and raised in the</a> <strong>New York City</strong> borough of Queens, and received an <u>economics</u> degree from the Wharton School.
  Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated 16 other candidates in the primaries.
  Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist.
  He was elected in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although he lost the popular vote.

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">He became the oldest first-term U.S. president,[c] and the first one without prior military or government service.
  His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency.
  The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics.
  Many of his comments and actions have also been characterized as racially charged or racist.
