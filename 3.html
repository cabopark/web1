    <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
    Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software,
      including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software,
      and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
  The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries.
  Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.
